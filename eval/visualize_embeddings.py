# visualize_embeddings.py
# --------------------------
# Visualizes learned feature embeddings using PCA (Think hw 4)
# - Passes individual images through ResNet encoder
# - Projects high-dimensional features to 3d space
# - Plots embeddings
# - Helps assess whether model learns rotation invariant features
